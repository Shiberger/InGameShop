# 🎮 In-Game Shop - Full-Stack E-commerce Application

A full-stack e-commerce application for an **in-game item shop**, featuring a **mobile frontend built with Flutter** and a **backend system developed with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB**. The application integrates a payment system via **PromptPay QR Code** using the **Omise payment gateway**.

This project was created to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of full-stack application development, from design and development to API integration and payment system management.
